- <space> is a special character 
- \n is another special character (new lines should be carefully handled)
- 0 is another special character (almost equal to space)
- a token should never match a special character
- all symbols (and combinatons) can be used as operators, letters and numbers should not be used to create operators
- operands consist of combinations of symbols and normal characters or consist of numbers
- names should only use normal characters
- all combinations of normal characters that are not matched by operands are names
- all names that are not directly matched are trying to be matched dynamically
- the 'void' token (created with (void)) will be ensured to exists in the main library

-----------
INTERPRETER
-----------
an interpreter should provide:
- a static symbol table 
- a statementgroup (to determine starting and statement end conditions)

OTHER
-----
- all rules not mentioned above could be implemented by own/external token libraries
