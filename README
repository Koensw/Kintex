KINTEX 
======

VERSIE: 2.0

(c) 2013 Koen Wolters

INTRODUCTION
------------

Kintex is a simple interpreter written in C++. It has the following features (at the moment):
* Basic operations like addition, subtraction etc.
* Floating-Point support
* Variables
* Functions
* Parentheses and brackets
* If and while statements
* Command-line interface
* Support for informative errors
* Few builtin functions

Kintex is a project for me to learn programming more advanced things and to learn something about compiler/interpreter logic.
